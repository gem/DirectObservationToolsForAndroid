Direct Observation Android Tool


[Install App via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.globalquakemodel.org.idctdo)


This tool allows users of Android tablets and smartphones to collect information about individual buildings for use in seismic or multi-hazard risk assessment. The building attributes are defined by the [GEM Building Taxonomy](https://www.globalquakemodel.org/what/physical-integrated-risk/building-taxonomy/).



The Direct Observation Android Tool has been compiled using [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).  The application also makes use of the JavaScript map library OpenLayers, version 2.11.

Tiles (with extension png.tile) for offline usage may be downloaded using [MOBAC](http://mobac.sourceforge.net)
